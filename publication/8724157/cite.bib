 abstract = {As Knowledge Graphs are symbolic constructs, specialized techniques have to be applied in order to make them compatible with data mining techniques. RDF2Vec is an unsupervised technique that can create task-agnostic numerical representations of the nodes in a KG by extending successful language modeling techniques. The original work proposed the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel to improve the quality of the representations. However, in this work, we show that the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel does little to improve walk embeddings in the context of a single Knowledge Graph. As an alternative, we examined five alternative strategies to extract information complementary to basic random walks and compare them on several benchmark datasets to show that research within this field is still relevant for node classification tasks.},
