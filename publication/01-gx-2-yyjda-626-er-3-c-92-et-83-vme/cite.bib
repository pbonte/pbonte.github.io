 abstract = {A healthy and safe indoor environment is an important part of containing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Therefore, this work presents a real-time Internet of things (IoT) software architecture to automatically calculate and visualize a COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk estimation. This risk estimation is based on indoor climate sensor data, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, which is fed into Streaming MASSIF, a semantic stream processing platform, to perform the computations. The results are visualized on a dynamic dashboard that automatically suggests appropriate visualizations based on the semantics of the data. To evaluate the complete architecture, the indoor climate during the student examination periods of January 2020 (pre-COVID) and January 2021 (mid-COVID) was analyzed. When compared to each other, we observe that the COVID-19 measures in 2021 resulted in a safer indoor environment.},
