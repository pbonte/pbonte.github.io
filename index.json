Existing IoT platforms often have issues with preserving the privacy of patient data. Moreover, configuring and managing context-aware stream processing queries in semantic IoT platforms requires much manual, labor-intensive effort. Generic queries can deal with context changes but often lead to performance issues caused by the need for expressive real-time semantic reasoning. In addition, query window parameters are part of the manual configuration and cannot be made context-dependent. To tackle these problems, this paper presents DIVIDE, a component for a semantic IoT platform that adaptively derives and manages the queries of the platform's stream processing components in a context-aware and scalable manner, and that enables privacy by design. By performing semantic reasoning to derive the queries when context changes are observed, their real-time evaluation does require any reasoning. The results of an evaluation on a homecare monitoring use case demonstrate how activity detection queries derived with DIVIDE can be evaluated in on average less than 3.7 seconds and can therefore successfully run on low-end IoT devices.","tags":["Context-aware query derivation","Internet of Things","cascading reasoning","semantic reasoning","homecare monitoring","SEMANTIC INTEROPERABILITY","HEALTH-CARE","BIG-DATA","FRAMEWORK","PLATFORM","SYSTEMS"],"title":"Context-aware query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE enabling privacy by design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maarten Vandenbrande","M.

This is mainly due to the rise of data-intensive domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Industries, Pervasive Health, and Social Media. To extract meaningful insights from these streams, they should be processed in real time, while solving an integration problem as these streams need to be combined with more static data and their domain knowledge. Ontologies are ideal for modeling this domain knowledge and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data within data-intensive domains such as the IoT. Expressive reasoning techniques, such as OWL2 DL reasoning, are needed to completely interpret the domain knowledge and for the extraction of meaningful decisions. Expressive reasoning techniques have mainly focused on static data environments, as it tends to become slow with growing datasets. There is thus a mismatch between expressive reasoning and the real-time requirements of data-intensive domains. In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging the gap between expressivity and efficiency while reasoning over high-velocity IoT data streams for the task of event enrichment. We present a structural caching technique that eliminates reoccurring reasoning steps by exploiting the characteristics of most IoT streams, i.e., streams typically produce events that are similar in structure and size. Our caching technique speeds up reasoning time up to thousands of times for fully fledged OWL2 DL reasoners and even tenths and hundreds of times for less expressive OWL2 RL and OWL2 EL reasoners.","tags":["OWL","ONTOLOGY","Stream reasoning","Event-based","Caching","IoT"],"title":"Bridging the gap between expressivity and efficiency in stream reasoning : a structural caching approach for IoT streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Van Onsem","Dieter De Paepe","Sander Vanden Hautte","Pieter Bonte","Veerle Ledoux","Annelies Lejon","Femke Ongenae","D.

As production environments tend to monitor a huge amount of these metrics, it prevents current state-of-the-art techniques to be deployed as the required computational resources is too high. This paper proposes a lightweight anomaly detection method that can be deployed in these environments without a reduction in accuracy. The approach works fully online, and does not require an extensive history set to be kept in memory. The method is benchmarked on the publicly available Numenta dataset, as well as a network monitoring dataset from different environments provided by a network management solution vendor. These benchmarks show the proposed technique to be very competitive with the current state-of-the-art and exceeding it in production applicability.","tags":["Anomaly detection","Network monitoring","Time series"],"title":"Hierarchical pattern matching for anomaly detection in time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Need for Expressive Stream Reasoning Benchmark Various benchmarks exist to evaluate expressive reasoning over static data sources. On the other hand, a plethora of benchmarks exists to evaluate RDF Stream Processing with no or limited support for reasoning. (Support for RDFS reasoning at most.) However, no benchmarks are available to evaluate expressive reasoning over continuous data streams. Therefore, we introduce OWL2Streams, an evaluation framework for expressive stream reasoning.\nWhy Expressive Reasoning? Many domains rely on rich background knowledge to fully capture the domain, such as Pervasive Health or the Internet of Things (IoT), requiring Expressive Reasoning to fully capture their domain knowledge. Furthermore, most IoT labeled ontologies on Linked Open Vocabularies require expressive reasoning techniques, such as OWL2 DL, to be fully interpreted.\nPushing Optimizations OWL2Streams aims at pushing optimizations for expressive reasoning over continuous data streams. It makes a distinction between static data, describing background information, and streaming data. OWL2Streams pushes optimizations for the following challenges:\n Size of the static data: the larger the size of the static data, the slower the reasoning. Optimizations can focus on only extracting relevant parts of the static data. Expressivity of the ontology: the expressivity negatively impacts the reasoning time, optimizations can focus on extracting only relevant statements from the ontology TBox. Frequency of the stream: the faster the updates in the stream, the faster the reasoning process needs to be able to provide results. Optimizations can focus on first filtering relevant facts from the data. Number of parallel streams: More streams imply more data, however, challenges arise when data from various streams need to be correlated. Numeric data streams: in domains such as the IoT, many streams contain numeric data. However, data property reasoning is not supported by many OWL2 reasoners. Optimizations could focus on filtering out events with numeric values that are not useful. Data Expiration: next to reasoning over the addition of data, the removal of data is even more complex. Optimizations could investigate adapted incremental reasoning techniques for expressive reasoning. (Currently, none exist for OWL2 DL.)  Supported Scenarios At this point, OWL2Streams supports three different scenarios focussing on different optimization opportunities. These scenarios are:\n Smart City: an adaption of the City Bench containing more elaborate background knowledge. Smart Building: a COVID-19 scenario, consisting of sensors that measure the air quality in various rooms. The domain knowledge allows to infer if certain rooms have higher probabilities for COVID-19 infections, based on the air quality and the activities in each room. University Management: An adaptation of the OWL2Bench benchmark. This scenario consists of a university where students register and enroll in a certain program. The data stream consists of the enrollment of the students.  Conclusion OWL2Streams is an evaluation framework for pushing the expressivity in Reasoning over continuous data streams.

As an alternative, we examined five alternative strategies to extract information complementary to basic random walks and compare them on several benchmark datasets to show that research within this field is still relevant for node classification tasks.","tags":["Knowledge graphs","Embeddings","Representation learning"],"title":"Walk extraction strategies for node embeddings with RDF2Vec in knowledge graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Weyns","Pieter Bonte","Bram Steenwinckel","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851762,"objectID":"803d6c813a3483c50c14adbfd5593114","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8675058/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:42.355956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8675058/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Embeddings\"","\"Knowledge Graph Embeddings\""],"title":"Conditional constraints for knowledge graph embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Mathias De Brouwer","Dörthe Arndt","Miel Vander Sande","Pieter Heyvaert","Anastasia Dimou","Pieter Colpaert","Ruben Verborgh","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851762,"objectID":"68aad1da59d378f0b3dbebaea2d45baf","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8681056/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:42.221521Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8681056/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"Streaming MASSIF\"","\"MASSIF\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"Transport\"","\"Dissect\""],"title":"Context-aware route planning : a personalized and situation-aware multi-modal transport routing approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathias De Brouwer","Pieter Bonte","Dörthe Arndt","Miel Vander Sande","Pieter Heyvaert","Anastasia Dimou","Ruben Verborgh","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851762,"objectID":"37e2cc6676ed76a3bbf9f0bc4bd81924","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8665815/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:42.486933Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8665815/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Distributed continuous home care provisioning through personalized monitoring \u0026 treatment planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851762,"objectID":"58eac25aaa8d9345327e1d1f323dde11","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8681059/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:42.08887Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8681059/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"Streaming MASSIF\"","\"MASSIF\"","\"Reasoning\""],"title":"RDF Stream processing prototyping with streaming MASSIF","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Sander Vanden Hautte","Annelies Lejon","Veerle Ledoux","Filip De Turck","Sofie Van Hoecke","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619006993,"objectID":"90b9fdd2778e6abfea8b5affbcfa0e07","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/bonte-2020-unsupervised/","publishdate":"2021-04-21T12:09:48.528784Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonte-2020-unsupervised/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"IoT\"","\"Time Series\"","\"Anomaly Detection\"","\"Deep Learning\""],"title":"Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Communication Networks: An Autoencoder Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;

By combining this generated data with background knowledge and performing expressive reasoning upon this combination, meaningful decisions can be made. Furthermore, this continuously generated data typically originates from multiple heterogeneous sources. Ontologies are ideal for modeling the domain and facilitates the integration of heterogeneous produced data with background knowledge. Furthermore, expressive ontology reasoning allows to infer implicit facts and enables intelligent decision making. The data produced in these domains is often volatile. Time-critical systems, such as IoT Nurse Call systems, require timely processing of the produced IoT data. However, there is still a mismatch between volatile data and expressive ontology reasoning, since the incoming data frequency is often higher than the reasoning time. For this reason, we present an approximation technique that allows to extract a subset of data to speed-up the reasoning process. We demonstrate this technique in a Nurse Call proof of concept where the locations of the nurses are tracked and the most suited nurse is selected when the patient launches a call and in an extension of an existing benchmark. We managed to speed up the reasoning process up to 10 times for small datasets and up to more than 1000 times for large datasets.","tags":["\"ONTOLOGY\"","\"STREAMS\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"streams\"","\"event-based\"","\"ontology\"","\"nurse call\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"eHealth\""],"title":"Subset reasoning for event-based systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851763,"objectID":"d8a549ff12fcbe04c11d8951c9f55a0d","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8623325/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:42.887728Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8623325/","section":"publication","summary":"The continuous financial pressure on hospitals forces them to rethink various workflows.

We pay special attention to the explainability of the self-learning system, such that management understands the learned causes and remains in control over the automated process. This is achieved by providing the learned causes as sentences that can be understood by non-technical personnel and allowing these causes to first be supervised before the system takes them into account. Once approved, the system will calculate how much more time should be assigned to these transports in order to avoid future delays. As a result, the scheduling of patient transportation can be automatically optimized, while management remains in full control of the process.","tags":["\"DYNAMIC TRANSPORTATION\"","\"ONTOLOGIES\"","\"HEALTH\"","\"Rule learning\"","\"ontology\"","\"hospital transport\""],"title":"Towards optimizing hospital patient transports by automatically identifying interpretable causes of delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Tommasini","Pieter Bonte","Emanuele Della Valle","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851763,"objectID":"d2119d8ce50dcddb0cd77a4d3487d07d","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8581984/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:43.841273Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8581984/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"Complex Event Recognition\""],"title":"A query model for ontology-based event processing over RDF streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851763,"objectID":"faeff7cf6bab9d91d3993499a845fdda","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8577848/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:43.442712Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8577848/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"Streaming MASSIF\"","\"MASSIF\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"eHealth\""],"title":"Context-aware patient monitoring through sensor streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dörthe Arndt","Pieter Bonte","Alexander Dejonghe","Ruben Verborgh","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851763,"objectID":"e23d4000a4275d59d5b793fba03ec1aa","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8552458/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:43.710775Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8552458/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Reasoning\"","\"IoT\""],"title":"SENSdesc : connect sensor queries and context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke De Backere","Pieter Bonte","Stijn Verstichel","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851764,"objectID":"37ad0ec4f641e066d59dea2fb8ecf77c","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8550825/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:43.973326Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8550825/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2013, the Flemish Government launched the Vitalink platform.

Through a case study, the possibility of interaction with cloud solutions for healthcare is also investigated upon; this was initially not the focus of Vitalink. The Vitalink initiative provides support for secure data sharing in primary healthcare, which in the long term will improve the efficiency of care and will decrease costs. Based on the results of the case study, Vitalink allowed cloud solutions or applications not providing end-to-end security to use their system.

To perform meaningful analysis over multiple of these streams, stream processing needs to support expressive reasoning capabilities to infer implicit facts and temporal reasoning to capture temporal dependencies. However, current approaches cannot perform the required reasoning expressivity while detecting time dependencies over high frequency data streams. There is still a mismatch between the complexity of processing and the rate data is produced in volatile domains. Therefore, we introduce Streaming MASSIF, a Cascading Reasoning approach performing expressive reasoning and complex event processing over high velocity streams. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that solves the problem of expressive reasoning over high frequency streams by introducing a hierarchical approach consisting of multiple layers. Each layer minimizes the processed data and increases the complexity of the data processing. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that has not been fully realized. Streaming MASSIF is a layered approach allowing IoT service to subscribe to high-level and temporal dependent concepts in volatile data streams. We show that Streaming MASSIF is able to handle high velocity streams up to hundreds of events per second, in combination with expressive reasoning and complex event processing. Streaming MASSIF realizes the Cascading Reasoning vision and is able to combine high expressive reasoning with high throughput of processing. Furthermore, we formalize semantically how the different layers in our Cascading Reasoning Approach collaborate.","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"Streaming MASSIF\"","\"MASSIF\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"Cascading Reasoning\"","\"IoT\""],"title":"Streaming MASSIF : cascading reasoning for efficient processing of iot data streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathias De Brouwer","Femke Ongenae","Pieter Bonte","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851764,"objectID":"674ee2ec40efa657f8d25ee35f606591","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8581923/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:44.10764Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8581923/","section":"publication","summary":"In hospitals and smart nursing homes, ambient-intelligent care rooms are equipped with many sensors. They can monitor environmental and body parameters, and detect wearable devices of patients and nurses. Hence, they continuously produce data streams. This offers the opportunity to collect, integrate and interpret this data in a context-aware manner, with a focus on reactivity and autonomy. However, doing this in real time on huge data streams is a challenging task. In this context, cascading reasoning is an emerging research approach that exploits the trade-off between reasoning complexity and data velocity by constructing a processing hierarchy of reasoners. Therefore, a cascading reasoning framework is proposed in this paper. A generic architecture is presented allowing to create a pipeline of reasoning components hosted locally, in the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The architecture is implemented on a pervasive health use case, where medically diagnosed patients are constantly monitored, and alarming situations can be detected and reacted upon in a context-aware manner. A performance evaluation shows that the total system latency is mostly lower than 5 s, allowing for responsive intervention by a nurse in alarming situations. Using the evaluation results, the benefits of cascading reasoning for healthcare are analyzed.","tags":["\"ONTOLOGY\"","\"MANAGEMENT\"","\"STREAMS\"","\"SPARQL\"","\"pervasive healthcare\"","\"cascading reasoning\"","\"stream reasoning\"","\"eHealth\"","\"Reasoning\""],"title":"Towards a cascading reasoning framework to support responsive ambient-intelligent healthcare interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Jeroen Schaballie","W.

Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.","tags":["\"RSP\"","\"Stream Reasoning\"","\"IoT\"","\"eHealth\"","\"MASSIF\"","\"Reasoning\""],"title":"The MASSIF platform : a modular and semantic platform for the development of flexible IoT services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke De Backere","Pieter Bonte","Stijn Verstichel","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851764,"objectID":"01ac79c8e00ae2ffb920845020370d3a","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8541182/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:44.643922Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8541182/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Currently, healthcare services, such as institutional care facilities, are burdened with an increasing number of elderly people and individuals with chronic illnesses and a decreasing number of competent caregivers.

This semantic, data-driven and cloud based back-end system facilitates independent living by offering information and knowledge-based services to the resident and his/her (in)formal caregivers. Data and context information are gathered to realize context-aware and personalized services and to support residents in meeting their daily needs. This body of data, originating from heterogeneous data and information sources, is sent to personalized services, where is fused, thus creating an overview of the resident's current situation. Results: The architecture of the OCarePlatform is proposed, which is based on a service-oriented approach, together with its different components and their interactions. The implementation details are presented, together with a running example. A scalability and performance study of the OCarePlatform was performed. The results indicate that the OCarePlatform is able to support a realistic working environment and respond to a trigger in less than 5 seconds. The system is highly dependent on the allocated memory. Conclusion: The data-driven character of the OCarePlatform facilitates easy plug-in of new functionality, enabling the design of personalized, context-aware services. The OCarePlatform leads to better support for elderly people and individuals with chronic illnesses, who live independently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

An alternative is to use a rule-based reasoner together with the OWL RL/RDF rules as stated in the specification of the OWL 2 language profiles. In most cases this approach actually improves reasoning times, but due to the complexity of the rules, not as much as it could. In this paper we present an improved strategy: based on the TBoxes of the ontologies involved in a reasoning task, we create more specific rules which then can be used for further reasoning. We make use of the EYE reasoner and its logic Notation3. In this logic, rules can be employed to derive new rules which makes the rule creation a reasoning step on its own. We evaluate our implementation on a semantic nurse call system. Our results show that adding a pre-reasoning step to produce specialized rules improves reasoning times by around 75 %.","tags":["\"Notation3\"","\"Rule-based reasoning\"","\"OWL 2 RL\"","\"Reasoning\""],"title":"Improving OWL RL reasoning in N3 by using specialized rules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851765,"objectID":"45b55bd66b20fd263cb32273982df4f0","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8505900/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:44.912469Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8505900/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"eHealth\"","\"Inductive Reasoning\"","\"Rule learning\""],"title":"Learning semantic rules for intelligent transport scheduling in hospitals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Eveline Hoogstoel","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851765,"objectID":"27ce34924aeb725cdc901d1db8002f05","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8506052/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:45.04484Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8506052/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"eHealth\"","\"Inductive Reasoning\"","\"Rule learning\""],"title":"Mining semantic rules for optimizing transport assignments in hospitals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke Ongenae","Pieter Bonte","Jeroen Schaballie","Bert Vankeirsbilck","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851765,"objectID":"483dad3dc617ffa8c8a0c27f09bad257","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/8500134/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:45.347819Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8500134/","section":"publication","summary":"The increase of ICT infrastructure in hospitals offer opportunities for cost reduction by optimizing workflows, while maintaining quality of care.

Which specific nurse is called cannot be controlled, as there is no extra information available. This is different for solutions based on semantic knowledge: if the state of care givers (busy or free), their current position, and for example their skills are known, a system can always choose the best suitable nurse for a call. In this paper we describe such a semantic nurse call system implemented using the EYE reasoner and Notation3 rules. The system is able to perform OWL-RL reasoning. Additionally, we use rules to implement complex decision trees. We compare our solution to an implementation using OWL-DL, the Pellet reasoner, and SPARQL queries. We show that our purely rule-based approach gives promising results. Further improvements will lead to a mature product which will significantly change the organization of modern hospitals.","tags":["\"Notation3\"","\"OWL 2 RL\"","\"eHealth\"","\"Reasoning\""],"title":"Ontology reasoning using rules in an eHealth context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Jeroen Schaballie","Dörthe Arndt","R Wauters","Philip Leroux","Ruben Verborgh","Rik Van de Walle","Erik Mannens","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851765,"objectID":"add542a733090ef433b8c4a034e8f801","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/7237124/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:45.613354Z","relpermalink":"/publication/7237124/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"MASSIF\"","\"Media\""],"title":"Semantic intelligence for real-time automated media production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke De Backere","Femke Ongenae","Floris Van den Abeele","Jelle Nelis","Pieter Bonte","E Clement","M Philpott","Jeroen Hoebeke","Stijn Verstichel","Ann Ackaert","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851766,"objectID":"7e57c451ab06f0fde4ee96026d211904","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/7235308/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:46.007004Z","relpermalink":"/publication/7235308/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"ACTIVITY RECOGNITION\"","\"DETECTION SYSTEM\"","\"DAILY-LIFE\"","\"CLASSIFICATION\"","\"NETWORKS\"","\"MOTION\"","\"SENSOR\"","\"Fall detection\"","\"Fall risk assessment\"","\"Ontology\"","\"Semantic\"","\"Context-aware\""],"title":"Towards a social and context-aware multi-sensor fall detection and risk assessment platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Floris Van den Abeele","Jeroen Hoebeke","Femke De Backere","Femke Ongenae","Pieter Bonte","Stijn Verstichel","T Carlier","P Crombez","K De Gryse","S Danschotter","Ingrid Moerman","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618851766,"objectID":"deeeb80da41f816a3a59f0b9ecf80f02","permalink":"http://pieterbonte.be/publication/5660331/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T17:02:46.274078Z","relpermalink":"/publication/5660331/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"eHealth\""],"title":"OCareClouds: improving home care by interconnecting elderly, care networks and their living environments","type":"publication"}]
